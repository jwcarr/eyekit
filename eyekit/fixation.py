        Given a `eyekit.text.TextBlock`, snap each fixation to the line that

        parameters or require NumPy/SciPy to be installed. See [Carr et al.
        (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01554-0) for a full
        description and evaluation of these methods. Note that in single-line
        TextBlocks, the `method` parameter has no effect: all fixations will
        be snapped to the one line. If a list of methods is passed in, each
        fixation will be snapped to the line with the most "votes" across the
        selection of methods (in case of ties, the left-most method takes
        priority). This "wisdom of the crowd" approach usually results in
        greater performance than any one algorithm individually; ideally, you

        a fixation is moved in the correction. If this value is high

        correction is low. Kappa, which is only calculated when multiple
        methods are applied, is a measure of agreement among the methods. If
