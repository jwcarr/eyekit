def snap_to_lines(fixation_sequence, text_block, method='warp', **kwargs):
	'''
	
	Given a `FixationSequence` and `TextBlock`, snap each fixation to the
	line that it most likely belongs to, eliminating any y-axis variation
	or drift. Returns a copy of the fixation sequence. Several methods
	are available, some of which take optional parameters. For a full
	description and evaluation of these methods, see [Carr et al. (2020)](https://osf.io/jg3nc/).

	- `chain` : Chain consecutive fixations that are sufficiently close to each other, and then assign chains to their closest text lines. Default params: `x_thresh=192`, `y_thresh=32`
	- `cluster` : Classify fixations into *m* clusters based on their Y-values, and then assign clusters to text lines in positional order.
	- `merge` : Form a set of progressive sequences and then reduce the set to *m* by repeatedly merging those that appear to be on the same line. Merged sequences are then assigned to text lines in positional order. Default params: `y_thresh=32`, `g_thresh=0.1`, `e_thresh=20`
	- `regress` : Find *m* regression lines that best fit the fixations and group fixations according to best fit regression lines, and then assign groups to text lines in positional order. Default params: `k_bounds=(-0.1, 0.1)`, `o_bounds=(-50, 50)`, `s_bounds=(1, 20)`
	- `segment` : Segment fixation sequence into *m* subsequences based on *m*â€“1 most-likely return sweeps, and then assign subsequences to text lines in chronological order.
	- `split` : Split fixation sequence into subsequences based on best candidate return sweeps, and then assign subsequences to closest text lines.
	- `warp` : Map fixations to word centers by finding a monotonically increasing mapping with minimal cost, effectively resulting in *m* subsequences, and then assign fixations to the lines that their mapped words belong to, effectively assigning subsequences to text lines in chronological order.
