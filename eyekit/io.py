def import_asc(file_path, filter_variables={}, extract_variables=[]):
    """

    Import an ASC file produced from an EyeLink device. By default, this will
    import all trials in the ASC file, where a trial is defined as all
    fixations (EFIX lines) that occur within a STARTâ€“END block. Optionally,
    the importer can try to filter only those trials that match certain
    user-defined variables. For example, if the filter_variables argument is
    set to:

    ```
    {"trial_type":"test", "passage_id":["A", "B", "C"]}
    ```

    the importer will only extract trials where "trial_type" is set to "test"
    and "passage_id" is set to either "A", "B", or "C". Variables are somewhat
    loosely defined as some string that occurs in a MSG line; anything that
    follows this string is its value. For example, if a trial in your ASC file
    contained these messages:

    ```
    MSG 4244101 !V TRIAL_VAR trial_type test
    MSG 4244101 !V TRIAL_VAR passage_id A
    ```

    then this trial would be extracted. The extract_variables argument can be
    used to extract further variables without any filtering. This could be
    used, for example, to extract trial or stimulus IDs that were written to
    the data stream as messages. If unsure, you should first inspect your ASC
    file to see what messages you wrote to the data stream.

    The importer will return something like this:

    ```
    {
        "imported_from" : "my_asc_file.asc",
        "trials" : [
            {
