    """

    Import data from an ASC file produced from an SR Research EyeLink device
    (you will first need to use SR Research's Edf2asc tool to convert your
    original EDF files to ASC). The importer will extract all trials from the
    ASC file, where a trial is defined as a sequence of fixations (EFIX lines)
    that occur inside a STARTâ€“END block. Optionally, the importer can extract
    user-defined variables from the ASC file and associate them with the
    appropriate trial. For example, if your ASC file contains messages like
    this:

    ```
    MSG 4244101 !V TRIAL_VAR trial_type practice
    MSG 4244101 !V TRIAL_VAR passage_id 1
    ```

    then you could extract the variables `"trial_type"` and `"passage_id"`. A
    variable is some string that is followed by a space; anything that follows
    this space is the variable's value. By default, the importer looks for
    variables that follow the END tag. However, if your variables are placed
    before the START tag, then set the `placement_of_variables` argument to
    `"before_start"`. If unsure, you should first inspect your ASC file to see
    what messages you wrote to the data stream and where they are placed. The
    importer will return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
    represents a single trial and contains the fixations along with any other
    extracted variables. For example:

    ```
    [
        {
            "trial_type" : "practice",
            "passage_id" : "1",
