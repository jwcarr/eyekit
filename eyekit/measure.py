    Given a `eyekit.text.TextBlock` and `eyekit.fixation.FixationSequence`,
    distribute the durations of the fixations probabilistically across the
    `eyekit.text.TextBlock`. Specifically, the duration of fixation *f* is
    distributed over all characters *C* in its line according to the
    probability that the reader is "seeing" each character (see
    `p_characters_fixation()`), and this is summed over all fixations:

    $$\\sum_{f \\in F} p(C|f) \\cdot f_\\mathrm{dur}$$

    For a given fixation *f*, we compute a Gaussian distribution over all
    characters in the line according to:

    $$p(c|f) \\propto \\mathrm{exp} \\frac{ -\\mathrm{ED}(f_\\mathrm{pos}, c_\\mathrm{pos})^2 }{2\\gamma^2}$$

    where *Î³* (`gamma`) is a free parameter controlling the rate at which
    probability decays with the Euclidean distance (ED) between the position
    of fixation *f* and the position of character *c*.

    Returns a 2D Numpy array, the sum of which is equal to the total duration
    of all fixations. This can be passed to `eyekit.vis.Image.draw_heatmap()`
    for visualization. Duration mass reveals the parts of the text that
