"doc":"Eyekit is a Python package for analyzing reading behavior using eyetracking data. Eyekit aims to be entirely independent of any particular eyetracker hardware, experiment software, or data formats. It has an object-oriented style that defines three core objects \u2013 the TextBlock, InterestArea, and FixationSequence \u2013 that you bring into contact with a bit of coding.  Is Eyekit the Right Tool for Me?                 - You want to analyze which parts of a text someone is looking at and for how long. - You need convenient tools for extracting areas of interest from texts, such as specific words, phrases, or letter combinations. - You want to calculate common reading measures, such as gaze duration or initial landing position. - You need support for arbitrary fonts, multiline passages, right-to-left text, or non-alphabetical scripts. - You want the flexibility to define custom reading measures and to build your own reproducible processing pipeline. - You would like tools for dealing with noise and calibration issues, and for discarding fixations according to your own criteria. - You want to share your data in an open format and produce publication-ready vector graphics. Installation       Eyekit may be installed using  pip :   pip install eyekit   Eyekit is compatible with Python 3.8+. Its main dependency is the graphics library [Cairo](https: cairographics.org), which you might also need to install if it's not already on your system. Many Linux distributions have Cairo built in. On a Mac, it can be installed using [Homebrew](https: brew.sh):  brew install cairo . On Windows, it can be installed using [Anaconda](https: anaconda.org/anaconda/cairo):  conda install -c anaconda cairo . Getting Started        - Once installed, import Eyekit in the normal way:   import eyekit   Eyekit makes use of three core objects: the  fixation.FixationSequence ,  text.TextBlock , and  text.InterestArea . Much of Eyekit's functionality involves bringing these objects into contact. Typically, you define particular areas of the  text.TextBlock that are of interest (phrases, words, morphemes, letters .) and check to see which fixations from the  fixation.FixationSequence fall in those  text.InterestArea s and for how long.  The FixationSequence object Fixation data is represented in a  fixation.FixationSequence . Usually you will import fixation data from some raw data files, but for now let's just create some pretend data to play around with:   seq = eyekit.FixationSequence( 106, 490, 0, 100], [190, 486, 100, 200], [230, 505, 200, 300], [298, 490, 300, 400], [361, 497, 400, 500], [430, 489, 500, 600], [450, 505, 600, 700], [492, 491, 700, 800], [562, 505, 800, 900], [637, 493, 900, 1000], [712, 497, 1000, 1100], [763, 487, 1100, 1200 )   At a minimum, each fixation is represented by four numbers: its x-coordinate, its y-coordinate, its start time, and its end time (so, in this example, they all last 100ms). Once created, a  fixation.FixationSequence can be traversed, indexed, and sliced just like an ordinary  list . For example,   print(seq[5:10])  FixationSequence[Fixation[430,489],  ., Fixation[637,493   slices out fixations 5 through 9 into a new  fixation.FixationSequence object. A  fixation.FixationSequence (and the  fixation.Fixation objects it contains) has various properties that you can query:   print(len(seq  Number of fixations  12 print(seq.duration)  Duration of whole sequence  1200 print(seq[0].duration)  Duration of first fixation  100 print(seq[-1].xy)  xy coordinates of final fixation  (763, 487) print(seq[1].x)  x coordinate of second fixation  190    The TextBlock object A  text.TextBlock can represent a word, sentence, or passage of text. When you create a  text.TextBlock object, it is necessary to specify various details such as its position on the screen and the font:   sentence = 'The quick brown fox [jump]{stem}[ed]{suffix} over the lazy dog.' txt = eyekit.TextBlock(sentence, position=(100, 500), font_face='Times New Roman', font_size=36) print(txt)  TextBlock[The quick brown f .]   Eyekit has a simple scheme for marking up interest areas, as you can see in the above sentence. Square brackets are used to mark the interest area itself (in this case  jump and  ed ) and curly braces are used to provide a unique ID for each interest area (in this case  stem and  suffix ). We can extract a particular interest area by using its ID:   print(txt['stem'])  InterestArea[stem, jump]   Manually marking up interest areas in the raw text is typically useful if you have a small number of known interest areas. However, Eyekit also provides more powerful tools for extracting interest areas programmatically. For example, you can use  text.TextBlock.words() to iterate over every word in the text as an  text.InterestArea without needing to explicitly mark each of them up in the raw text:   for word in txt.words(): print(word)  InterestArea[0:0:3, The]  InterestArea[0:4:9, quick]  InterestArea[0:10:15, brown]  InterestArea[0:16:19, fox]  InterestArea[0:20:26, jumped]  InterestArea[0:27:31, over]  InterestArea[0:32:35, the]  InterestArea[0:36:40, lazy]  InterestArea[0:41:44, dog]   You can also supply a regular expression to iterate over words that match a certain pattern; words that end in  ed for example:   for word in txt.words('.+ed'): print(word)  InterestArea[0:20:26, jumped]   or just the four-letter words:   for word in txt.words('.{4}'): print(word)  InterestArea[0:27:31, over]  InterestArea[0:36:40, lazy]   or case-insensitive occurrences of the word  the :   for word in txt.words('(?i)the'): print(word)  InterestArea[0:0:3, The]  InterestArea[0:32:35, the]   You can collate a bunch of interest areas into a list for convenient access later on. For example, if you wanted to do some analysis on all the three-letter words, you might extract them and assign them to a variable like so:   three_letter_words = list(txt.words('.{3}' print(three_letter_words)  [InterestArea[0:0:3, The], InterestArea[0:16:19, fox], InterestArea[0:32:35, the], InterestArea[0:41:44, dog   You can also slice out arbitrary interest areas by using the row and column indices of a section of text. Here, for example, we are extracting a two-word section of text from line 0 (the first and only line) and characters 10 through 18:   brown_fox_ia = txt[0:10:19] print(brown_fox_ia)  InterestArea[0:10:19, brown fox]    The InterestArea object Once you've extracted an  text.InterestArea , you can access various properties about it:   print(brown_fox_ia.text)  get the string represented in this IA  brown fox print(brown_fox_ia.width)  get the pixel width of this IA  157.974609375 print(brown_fox_ia.center)  get the xy coordinates of the center of the IA  (328.4365234375, 491.94921875) print(brown_fox_ia.onset)  get the x coordinate of the IA onset  253.94921875 print(brown_fox_ia.location)  get the location of the IA in its parent TextBlock  (0, 10, 19) print(brown_fox_ia.id)  get the ID of the IA  0:10:19   By default, an  text.InterestArea will have an ID of the form  0:10:19 , which refers to the unique position that it occupies in the text. However, you can also change the IDs to something more descriptive, if you wish. For example, you could enumerate the words in the text and give each one a number:   for i, word in enumerate(txt.words( : word.id = f'word{i}'   and, since  text.InterestArea s are passed around by reference, the IDs will update everywhere. For example, it we print the  three_letter_words list we created earlier, we find that it now reflects the new IDs:   print(three_letter_words)  [InterestArea[word0, The], InterestArea[word3, fox], InterestArea[word6, the], InterestArea[word8, dog   The  text.InterestArea defines the  in operator in a special way so that you can conveniently check if a fixation falls inside its bounding box. For example:   for fixation in seq: if fixation in brown_fox_ia: print(fixation)  Fixation[298,490]  Fixation[361,497]   The  text.TextBlock also provides some more convenient methods for asking these kinds of questions, for example:   print(txt.which_word(seq[3]  which word is fixation 3 inside?  InterestArea[word2, brown] print(txt.which_character(seq[3]  which character specifically?  InterestArea[0:12:13, o]   An  text.InterestArea can be any sequence of consecutive characters, and, as you can see, it's possible to define several overlapping  text.InterestArea s at the same time:  txt['word4'] ( jumped ),  txt['stem'] ( jump ),  txt['suffix'] ( ed ), and  txt[0:24:25] (the  p in  jumped ) can all coexist. Visualization       - Now that we've created a  fixation.FixationSequence and  text.TextBlock , and we've extracted some  text.InterestArea s, it would be useful to visualize how these things relate to each other. To create a visualization, we begin by creating an  vis.Image object, specifying the pixel dimensions of the screen:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080)   Next we render our text and fixations onto this image:   img.draw_text_block(txt) img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq)   Note that the elements of the image will be layered in the order in which these methods are called \u2013 in this case, the fixations will be rendered on top of the text. Finally, we save the image (Eyekit supports PDF, EPS, SVG, or PNG):   img.save('quick_brown.svg')    Sometimes it's useful to see the text in the context of the entire screen, as is the case here; other times, we'd like to remove all that excess white space and focus in on the text. To do this, you need to specify a crop margin; the image will then be cropped to the size of the text block plus the specified margin:   img.save('quick_brown_cropped.svg', crop_margin=2)    There are many other options for creating custom visualizations, which you can explore in the  vis module. For example, if you wanted to depict the bounding boxes around the two interest areas we manually marked-up in the raw text, you might do this:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_text_block(txt) img.draw_rectangle(txt['stem'], color='crimson') img.draw_rectangle(txt['suffix'], color='cadetblue') img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq) img.save('quick_brown_with_zones.svg', crop_margin=2)    Colors can be specified as a tuple of RGB values (e.g.  (220, 20, 60) ), a hex triplet (e.g.  DC143C ), or any [standard HTML color name](https: www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) (e.g.  crimson ). Similarly, we can do the same thing with the list of three-letter words we created earlier:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_text_block(txt) for word in three_letter_words: img.draw_rectangle(word, fill_color='slateblue', opacity=0.5) img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq) img.save('quick_brown_with_3letter_words.svg', crop_margin=2)    Or, indeed, all words in the text:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_text_block(txt) for word in txt.words(): img.draw_rectangle(word, color='hotpink') img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq) img.save('quick_brown_with_all_words.svg', crop_margin=2)    Note that, by default, each  text.InterestArea 's bounding box is slightly padded by, at most, half of the width of a space character. This ensures that, even if a fixation falls between two words, it will still be assigned to one of them. Padding is only applied to an  text.InterestArea 's edge if that edge adjoins a non-alphabetical character (i.e. spaces and punctuation). Thus, when  jumped was divided into separate stem and suffix areas above, no padding was applied word-internally. If desired, automatic padding can be turned off by setting the  autopad argument to  False during the creation of the  text.TextBlock , or it can be controlled manually using the  text.InterestArea.adjust_padding() method. Taking Measurements          - The  measure module provides various functions for computing common reading measures, including, for example: -  measure.gaze_duration -  measure.initial_fixation_duration -  measure.initial_landing_position These functions take an  text.InterestArea and  fixation.FixationSequence as input, and return the measure of interest. For example, if we wanted to measure the initial landing position on the  stem interest area, we can apply the function like this:   print(eyekit.measure.initial_landing_position(txt['stem'], seq  2   The initial fixation on  jump landed on character 2. You can also apply these functions to a collection of interest areas. This will return a dictionary of results in which the keys are the  text.InterestArea IDs. For example, if we wanted to calculate the initial fixation duration on the three-letter words we extracted earlier, we can do this:   print(eyekit.measure.initial_fixation_duration(three_letter_words, seq  {'word0': 100, 'word3': 100, 'word6': 100, 'word8': 100}   In this case, we see that the initial fixation on each of the three-letter words lasted 100ms. Likewise, if we wanted to measure the gaze duration on all words, we can do this:   print(eyekit.measure.gaze_duration(txt.words(), seq  {'word0': 100, 'word1': 200, 'word2': 100, 'word3': 100, 'word4': 300, 'word5': 100, 'word6': 100, 'word7': 100, 'word8': 100}   The measurement functions provided by Eyekit can be used as-is or you can take a look at the underlying code and adapt them for your own purposes. Multiline Passages          So far, we've only looked at a single line  text.TextBlock , but handling multiline passages works in largely the same way. The principal difference is that when you instantiate your  text.TextBlock object, you must pass a  list of strings (one for each line of text):   txt = eyekit.TextBlock(['This is line 1', 'This is line 2'], position=(100, 500), font_face='Helvetica', font_size=24)   To see an example, we'll load in some real multiline passage data from [Pescuma et al.](https: osf.io/hx2sj/) which is included in the [Eyekit GitHub repository](https: github.com/jwcarr/eyekit):   example_data = eyekit.io.load('example/example_data.json') example_texts = eyekit.io.load('example/example_texts.json')   and in particular we'll extract the fixation sequence for trial 0 and its associated text:   seq = example_data['trial_0']['fixations'] pid = example_data['trial_0']['passage_id'] txt = example_texts[pid]['text']   As before, we can plot the fixation sequence over the passage of text to see what the data looks like:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_text_block(txt) img.draw_rectangle(txt[0:32:40], color='orange') img.draw_rectangle(txt[1:34:38], color='orange') img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq) img.save('multiline_passage.svg', crop_margin=4)    First, we might decide that we want to discard that final fixation, where the participant jumped a few lines up right at the end:   seq[-1].discard()  discard the final fixation   A second problem we can see here is that fixations on one line sometimes appear slightly closer to another line due to imperfect eyetracker calibration. For example, the fixation on the word  voce on line two actually falls into the bounding box of the word  vivevano on line one. Obviously, this will cause issues in your analysis further downstream, so it can be useful to first clean up the data by snapping every fixation to its appropriate line. Eyekit implements several different line assignment algorithms, which can be applied using the  fixation.FixationSequence.snap_to_lines() method:   original_seq = seq.copy()  keep a copy of the original sequence seq.snap_to_lines(txt)   This process adjusts the y-coordinate of each fixation so that matches the midline of its assigned line. To compare the corrected fixation sequence to the original, we could make two images and then combine them in a single  vis.Figure , like so:   img1 = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img1.draw_text_block(txt) img1.draw_rectangle(txt[0:32:40], color='orange') img1.draw_rectangle(txt[1:34:38], color='orange') img1.draw_fixation_sequence(original_seq) img1.set_caption('Before correction') img2 = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img2.draw_text_block(txt) img2.draw_rectangle(txt[0:32:40], color='orange') img2.draw_rectangle(txt[1:34:38], color='orange') img2.draw_fixation_sequence(seq) img2.set_caption('After correction') fig = eyekit.vis.Figure(1, 2)  one row, two columns fig.add_image(img1) fig.add_image(img2) fig.set_crop_margin(3) fig.save('multiline_passage_corrected.svg')    The fixation on  voce is now clearly associated with the correct word. Nevertheless,  snap_to_lines() should be applied with care, especially if the fixation data is very noisy or if the passage is being read nonlinearly. For advice on which method to use, see [Carr et al. (2021)](https: doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01554-0). Just like single-line texts, we can extract interest areas from the passage and take measurements in the same way. For example, if we were interested in the word  piccolo / piccola in this passage, we could extract all occurrences of this word and calculate the total fixation duration:   piccol_words = list(txt.words('piccol[oa]' durations = eyekit.measure.total_fixation_duration(piccol_words, seq) print(durations)  {'2:64:71': 253, '3:0:7': 347, '3:21:28': 246, '3:29:36': 319, '7:11:18': 268, '10:43:50': 178}   Furthermore, we could make a visualization to show this information:   img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_text_block(txt) for word in piccol_words: img.draw_rectangle(word, color='lightseagreen') x = word.onset y = word.y_br - 3 label = f'{durations[word.id]}ms' img.draw_annotation x, y), label, color='lightseagreen', font_face='Arial bold', font_size=4) img.draw_fixation_sequence(seq, color='gray') img.save('multiline_passage_piccol.svg', crop_margin=4)    Another way to look at the data is to distribute the fixations across the characters of the passage probabilistically, under the assumption that the closer a character is to a fixation point, the more likely it is that the reader is perceiving that character. This can be performed with the  measure.duration_mass function and plotted in a heatmap like so:   mass = eyekit.measure.duration_mass(txt, seq) img = eyekit.vis.Image(1920, 1080) img.draw_heatmap(txt, mass, color='green') img.save('multiline_passage_mass.svg', crop_margin=4)    Input\u2013Output       Eyekit is not especially committed to any particular file format; so long as you have an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, a start time, and an end time for each fixation, you are free to store data in whatever format you choose. However, as we have seen briefly above, Eyekit provides built-in support for JSON, where a typical data file might look something like this:   { \"trial_0\" : { \"participant_id\": \"John\", \"passage_id\": \"passage_a\", \"fixations\": { \"__FixationSequence__\": [ { \"x\": 412, \"y\": 142, \"start\": 770, \"end\": 900 }, { \"x\": 459, \"y\": 163, \"start\": 924, \"end\": 1035 }, { \"x\": 551, \"y\": 160, \"start\": 1062, \"end\": 1395 } ] } }, \"trial_1\" : { \"participant_id\": \"Mary\", \"passage_id\": \"passage_b\", \"fixations\": { \"__FixationSequence__\": [ { \"x\": 368, \"y\": 146, \"start\": 7, \"end\": 197 }, { \"x\": 431, \"y\": 154, \"start\": 415, \"end\": 660 }, { \"x\": 512, \"y\": 150, \"start\": 685, \"end\": 876 } ] } } }   This format is compact, structured, human-readable, and flexible. With the exception of the  __FixationSequence__ object, you can freely store whatever key-value pairs you want and you can organize the hierarchy of the data structure in any way that makes sense for your project. JSON files can be loaded using the  io.load() function from the  io module:   data = eyekit.io.load('example/example_data.json')   which automatically instantiates any  fixation.FixationSequence objects. Similarly, an arbitrary dictionary or list can be written out using the  io.save() function:   eyekit.io.save(data, 'output_data.json', compress=True)  skiptest   If  compress is set to  True , files are written in the most compact way; if  False , the file will be larger but more human-readable (like the example above). JSON can also be used to store  text.TextBlock objects \u2013 see  example_texts.json for an example \u2013 and you can even store  fixation.FixationSequence and  text.TextBlock objects in the same file if you like to keep things organized together. The  io module also provides functions for importing data from other formats:  io.import_asc() and  io.import_csv() . Once data has been imported this way, it may then be written out to Eyekit's native JSON format for quick access in the future. In time, I hope to add more functions to import data from common eyetracker formats. Getting Texts into Eyekit             - Getting texts into Eyekit can be a little tricky because their precise layout will be highly dependent on many different factors \u2013 not just the font and its size, but also the peculiarities of the experiment software and its text rendering engine. Ideally, all of your texts will be presented in some consistent way. For example, they might be centralized on the screen or they might have a consistent left edge. Once you specify how a text is positioned on screen, Eyekit calculates the location and bounding box of every character based on the particular font and font size you are using. The best way to check that the  text.TextBlock is set up correctly is to check it against a screenshot from your actual experiment. Eyekit provides the  tools.align_to_screenshot() tool to help you do this. First, set up your text block with parameters that you think are correct:   txt = eyekit.TextBlock(saramago_text, position=(300, 100), font_face='Baskerville', font_size=30, line_height=60, align='left', anchor='left')  skiptest   Then pass it to the  tools.align_to_screenshot() function along with the path to a PNG screenshot file:   eyekit.tools.align_to_screenshot(txt, 'screenshot.png')  skiptest    This will create a new image file ending  _eyekit.png (e.g.  screenshot_eyekit.png ). In this file, Eyekit's rendering of the text is presented in green overlaying the original screenshot image. The point where the two solid green lines intersect corresponds to the  text.TextBlock 's  position argument, and the dashed green lines show the baselines of subsequent lines of text, which is based on the  line_height argument. You can use this output image to adjust the parameters of the  text.TextBlock accordingly. In this example case, we see that the  text.TextBlock is positioned slightly too high up. If all of your texts are presented in a consistent way, you should only need to establish these parameters once. An alternative strategy would be to produce your experimental stimuli using Eyekit. For example, you could export images of your TextBlocks, and then display them full-size in some experiment software of your choice. Multilingual Support           Eyekit aims to offer good multilingual support, and the most common scripts \u2013 Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Latin \u2013 should all work out of the box. Right-to-left text (and bidirectional text in general) is supported \u2013 all you need to do is set  right_to_left=True when creating a  text.TextBlock . This ensures that the text will be rendered correctly and that functions like  measure.initial_landing_position and  fixation.FixationSequence.snap_to_lines will process the text in right-to-left direction. If you are working with the Arabic script, the text should be shaped prior to passing it into Eyekit using, for example, the [Arabic-reshaper](https: github.com/mpcabd/python-arabic-reshaper) package. Eyekit uses Cairo's \"toy font\" API to extract character metrics from the fonts available on your system. This API can be somewhat imperfect, especially if you are working with a particularly complex script or advanced typographical features, such as ligatures and kerning. However, in most cases it should be more than sufficient to extract areas of interest fairly accurately. When choosing a font for your experiment, the key thing to do is to make sure it supports all the glyphs in the language you're working with (some software, for example, may fall back to an alternative font in cases where a glyph is missing). Contributing       Eyekit is still in an early stage of development, but I am very happy to receive bug reports and suggestions via the [GitHub Issues page](https: github.com/jwcarr/eyekit/issues). If you'd like to work on new features or fix stuff that's currently broken, please feel free to fork the repo and/or raise an issue to discuss details. Before sending a pull request, you should check that the unit tests pass using [Pytest](https: pytest.org):   pytest tests/   and run [Black](https: black.readthedocs.io) over the codebase to normalize the style:   black eyekit/   Here are some areas of Eyekit that are currently underdeveloped: - Additional reading measures (e.g. of saccades and regressions) - Awareness of different experimental paradigms - Creation of animations/videos - More convenient methods for collating results into dataframes etc. - Importing data from other eyetracker data formats - Synchronization of fixation data with other types of experimental event - Support for nontextual objects, such as images or shapes - Interactive tools for cleaning up raw data - General testing and the addition of more unit tests"

Several methods are available (see below), some of which take optional parameters or require NumPy/SciPy to be installed. See [Carr et al. (2021)](https: doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01554-0) for a full description and evaluation of these methods. Note that in single-line TextBlocks, the  method parameter has no effect: all fixations will be snapped to the one line. If a list of methods is passed in, each fixation will be snapped to the line with the most \"votes\" across the selection of methods (in case of ties, the left-most method takes priority). This \"wisdom of the crowd\" approach usually results in greater performance than any one algorithm individually; ideally, you should choose a selection of methods that have different general properties: for example,  ['slice', 'cluster', 'warp'] . The  snap_to_lines() method returns two values, delta and kappa, which are indicators of data quality. Delta is the average amount by which a fixation is moved in the correction. If this value is high (e.g. > 30), this may indicate that the quality of the data or the correction is low. Kappa, which is only calculated when multiple methods are applied, is a measure of agreement among the methods. If this value is low (e.g. < 0.7), this may indicate that the correction is unreliable. -  chain : Chain consecutive fixations that are sufficiently close to each other, and then assign chains to their closest text lines. Default params:  x_thresh=192 ,  y_thresh=32 . Requires NumPy.

Requires SciPy. Original method implemented in [popEye](https: github.com/sascha2schroeder/popEye/). -  merge : Form a set of progressive sequences and then reduce the set to  m by repeatedly merging those that appear to be on the same line. Merged sequences are then assigned to text lines in positional order. Default params:  y_thresh=32 ,  gradient_thresh=0.1 ,  error_thresh=20 . Requires NumPy. Original method by [\u0160pakov et al. (2019)](https: doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1120-x). -  regress : Find  m regression lines that best fit the fixations and group fixations according to best fit regression lines, and then assign groups to text lines in positional order. Default params:  slope_bounds=(-0.1, 0.1) ,  offset_bounds=(-50, 50) ,  std_bounds=(1, 20) . Requires SciPy. Original method by [Cohen (2013)](https: doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0280-3). -  segment : Segment fixation sequence into  m subsequences based on  m \u20131 most-likely return sweeps, and then assign subsequences to text lines in chronological order. Requires NumPy. Original method by [Abdulin & Komogortsev (2015)](https: doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2015.7358786). -  slice : Form a set of runs and then reduce the set to  m by repeatedly merging those that appear to be on the same line. Merged sequences are then assigned to text lines in positional order. Default params:  x_thresh=192 ,  y_thresh=32 ,  w_thresh=32 ,  n_thresh=90 . Requires NumPy. Original method by [Glandorf & Schroeder (2021)](https: doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.09.069). -  split : Split fixation sequence into subsequences based on best candidate return sweeps, and then assign subsequences to closest text lines. Requires SciPy. Original method by [Carr et al. (2022)](https: doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01554-0). -  stretch : Find a stretch factor and offset that results in a good alignment between the fixations and lines of text, and then assign the transformed fixations to the closest text lines. Default params:  stretch_bounds=(0.9, 1.1) ,  offset_bounds=(-50, 50) . Requires SciPy.

This finds a monotonically increasing mapping between fixations and words with the shortest overall distance, effectively resulting in  m subsequences. Fixations are then assigned to the lines that their mapped words belong to, effectively assigning subsequences to text lines in chronological order. Requires NumPy. Original method by [Carr et al.

Optionally, the importer can extract user-defined variables and ms-by-ms samples. For example, if your ASC file contains messages like this:   MSG 4244101 trial_type practice MSG 4244101 passage_id 1 MSG 4244592 stim_onset   then you could extract the variables  \"trial_type\" and  \"passage_id\" . A variable is some string that is followed by a space; anything that follows this space is the variable's value. If the variable is not followed by a value (e.g.,  \"stim_onset\" above), then the time of the message is recorded as its value; this can be useful for recording the precise timing of an event. By default, the importer looks for variables that follow the END tag. However, if your variables are placed before the START tag, then set the  placement_of_variables argument to  \"before_start\" .

"doc":"Representation of a piece of text, which may be a word, sentence, or entire multiline passage. Initialized with: -  text The line of text (string) or lines of text (list of strings). Optionally, these can be marked up with arbitrary interest areas; for example,  The quick brown fox jump[ed]{past-suffix} over the lazy dog . -  position XY-coordinates describing the position of the TextBlock on the screen. The x-coordinate should be either the left edge, right edge, or center point of the TextBlock, depending on how the  anchor argument has been set (see below). The y-coordinate should always correspond to the baseline of the first (or only) line of text. -  font_face Name of a font available on your system. The keywords  italic and/or  bold can also be included to select the desired style, e.g.,  Minion Pro bold italic . -  font_size Font size in pixels. At 72dpi, this is equivalent to the font size in points. To convert a font size from some other dpi, use  eyekit.tools.font_size_at_72dpi() . -  line_height Distance between lines of text in pixels. In general, for single line spacing, the line height is equal to the font size; for double line spacing, the line height is equal to 2 \u00d7 the font size, etc. By default, the line height is assumed to be the same as the font size (single line spacing). If  autopad is set to  True (see below), the line height also effectively determines the height of the bounding boxes around interest areas. -  align Alignment of the text within the TextBlock. Must be set to  left ,  center , or  right , and defaults to  left (unless  right_to_left is set to  True , in which case  align defaults to  right ). -  anchor Anchor point of the TextBlock. This determines the interpretation of the  position argument (see above). Must be set to  left ,  center , or  right , and defaults to the same as the  align argument. For example, if  position was set to the center of the screen, the  align and  anchor arguments would have the following effects:  -  right_to_left Set to  True if the text is in a right-to-left script (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, etc.). If you are working with the Arabic script, you should reshape the text prior to passing it into Eyekit by using, for example, the Arabic-reshaper package. -  alphabet A string of characters that are to be considered alphabetical, which determines what counts as a word. By default, this includes any character defined as a letter or number in unicode, plus the underscore character. However, if you need to modify Eyekit's default behavior, you can set a specific alphabet here. For example, if you wanted to treat apostrophes and hyphens as alphabetical, you might use  alphabet=\"A-Za-z'-\" . This would allow a sentence like \"Where's the orang-utan?\" to be treated as three words rather than five. -  autopad If  True (the default), padding is automatically added to  InterestArea bounding boxes to avoid horizontal gaps between words and vertical gaps between lines. Horizontal padding (half of the width of a space character) is added to the left and right edges, unless the character to the left or right of the interest area is alphabetical (e.g. if the interest area is word-internal). Vertical padding is added to the top and bottom edges, such that bounding box heights will be equal to the  line_height (see above).  "
